      longDescription : "A zipper storage bag, slider storage bag, zipper bag, zip lock bag, or zippie is an inexpensive flexible rectangular storage bag, usually transparent, made of polyethylene[1][2] or similar plastic, that can be sealed and opened many times, either by a slider, which works in a similar way to a zip fastener, or by pinching together the two sides of a mechanical sealing mechanism with one's fingers. The bags are made in many sizes; a typical small size is 1.5 by 2.5 inches (3.8 cm × 6.4 cm), and a typical large size is 9 by 12 inches (23 cm × 30 cm). Material thickness (gauge) varies; smaller bags are typically 40 to 45 µm.",
